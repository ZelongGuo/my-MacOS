#### This note is about how to share files between Mac and my computer.

To do this, we actually used a very simple way, we share files in Mac so the computer can get access to the files in Mac. It's very simple.  

**<1>. Open *File Sharing* in *General* of your Mac.**

**<3>. Click the "Options..." of the above picture and then you can set the *account* and *password*.**  
Note: if you are required to input the KDE wallet password, you can search the KDE wallet in your computer (not you Mac), and then disable it.
